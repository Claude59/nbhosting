need to upgrade the 4 systemd services on both thurst and thermals to implement a new strategy to swap IPs
this new strategy should takes only seconds instead of currently minutes

not sure exactly how the 4 scripts were created in the first place, they don't seem to be under git
they should be though

new script to mimick is on Inria production network in
/net/servers/fedora/27/systemd/xxx-addr.service
