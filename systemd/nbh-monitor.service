[Unit]
Description=nbh-monitor kills jupyter containers that have been idle for too long

# the nbh-monitor script accepts options :
# --grace 20 : sets the idle timeout in minutes after which inactive containers
#    get stopped; under jupyter5, this is accurate, it really refers to
#    the latest user action
# --period 10 : monitor cycle in minutes; this also sets the frequency
#    at which counts.raw gets updated
###
# in devel mode we use shorter settings than the defaults
